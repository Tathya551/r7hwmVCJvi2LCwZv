# Project Learnings

## Overview

This project involved creating a personal portfolio website using React and React Router. Given my prior experience, most of the concepts were already familiar, turning this project into a valuable practice session.

## Familiar Grounds

### 1. React Components and Routing

As someone well-versed in React, working with components and setting up routes using React Router felt like second nature.

### 2. State Management and Conditional Rendering

The usage of React hooks, specifically `useState`, for state management and employing conditional rendering were already ingrained practices.

## New Learnings

### 1. File Download Button

One new and intriguing challenge was incorporating a download button for the resume. Although I was well-acquainted with React, creating a button to download a file required additional exploration. This particular task added a fresh perspective to an otherwise familiar project.

### 2. Working with GitHub pages

I'm updating this after the final deployement, but it was my first time working with GitHub pages. Firstly I had to explore what is GitHub pages and how do I deploy my site there. Once I did, I could only see README.md in the deployed address. From then on I've read countless articles on how to solve that issue, finally I landed at a GitHub discussion and following the steps suggested by the peers who encountered the same issue, I reached the solution. You can see it in the commits that how long it took me to solve this issue and how many different things did I try. It was a memorable learning experience nonetheless.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML

## Future Improvements

While the project aligns with the current requirements, there is always room for improvement:

- Refining the visual aesthetics for a more polished and professional appearance.
- Explore opportunities to integrate additional features or sections.
- Delve into advanced React Router features to enhance navigation in more complex scenarios.

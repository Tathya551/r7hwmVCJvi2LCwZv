      <p>Hello! I'm Tathya.</p>
      <p>
        I am a graduate in B.E. (Computer engineering), I completed my degree in
        June 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in MERN stack but my main expertise lies in frontend web
        development with a working proficiency in ReactJS and a good
        understanding of NextJS. I also possess a good grasp over backend
        development and I have knowledge of NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
        Although I primarily code in Javascript, I am also proficient in C,
        Java, and Python. I have the ability to solve problems and write and
        analyse code. I have a good understanding of mySQL and I have also
        worked with it. I am also familiar with noSQL, particularly mongoDB as a
        part of backend development.
      </p>
    </div>
